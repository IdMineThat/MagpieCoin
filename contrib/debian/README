This directory contains files used to package magpiecoind/magpiecoin-y-qt
for Debian-based Linux systems.

If you compile magpiecoind/magpiecoin-y-qt yourself, there are some
useful files here:

bitcoin: URI support
--------------------

magpiecoin-y-qt.desktop  (Gnome / Open Desktop)
To install:
  sudo desktop-file-install magpiecoin-y-qt.desktop

If you build yourself, you will either need to modify the paths in
the .desktop file or copy or symlink your magpiecoin-y-qt binary to /usr/bin
and the ../../share/pixmaps/bitcoin128.png to /usr/share/pixmaps
